Total Ways to Sum II
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


How many different distinct ways can the number 76 be written as a sum of integers contained in the set:

[1,5,9,11,12,13,15,22,26,27]?

You may use each integer in the set zero or more times.


Encryption I: Caesar Cipher
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


Caesar cipher is one of the simplest encryption technique. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and A would become X (because of rotation).

You are given an array with two elements:
  ["DEBUG TABLE PRINT POPUP LOGIN", 19]
The first element is the plaintext, the second element is the left shift value.

Return the ciphertext as uppercase string. Spaces remains the same.

Algorithmic Stock Trader I
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 5 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of stock prices (which are numbers) where the i-th element represents the stock price on day i:

14,32,10,60,94,54

Determine the maximum possible profit you can earn using at most one transaction (i.e. you can only buy and sell the stock once). If no profit can be made then the answer should be 0. Note that you have to buy the stock before you can sell it

Array Jumping Game
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 1 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of integers:

0,2,1

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively

Array Jumping Game
You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 1 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.


You are given the following array of integers:

2,0,8,5,0,10,9,5,0,3,0,2,9

Each element in the array represents your MAXIMUM jump length at that position. This means that if you are at position i and your maximum jump length is n, you can jump to any position from i to i+n.

Assuming you are initially positioned at the start of the array, determine whether you are able to reach the last index.

Your answer should be submitted as 1 or 0, representing true and false respectively
